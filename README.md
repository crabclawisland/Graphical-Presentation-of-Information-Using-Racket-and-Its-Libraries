# Graphical-Presentation-of-Information-Using-Racket-and-Its-Libraries
##Lapsus OPL S15 Final Project

####Notes
* Song curently does not stop after slideshow ends. The only way to kill it is to close Dr.Racket. Comment out (play-sound) line if you dont want to deal with it. Working on a fix.
* Images in repo must be in same folder as code to work. Backup copy of images canbe download from dropbox link below-- just move code to the iamge folder before running.
* Slides are timed to change after twenty seconds. If you attempt to manually navigate the slideshow, slides will appear out of order.
